## Task

Make Me Functional
In this mode, you are given the HTML and CSS template and your focus should be on adding the required functionality with JS.

Implement the following functionalities:
- currently the div with the id of time displays a static random time inside. Update the clock to display the correct current time;
- it should run just like a real clock, updating the time every second.

P.S. The challenge did not allow changes to the HTML and CSS code. However, I made the following modifications:
- adjusted the font size and padding for the &gt;h1&lt; element;
- added a button to toggle between dark and light themes;
- integrated a dark/light toggle button using the Font Awesome library;
- for screens with a width of 767px or less, the timer display shifts up, and the toggle button shifts down for better usability on mobile devices.
